# strava-gpx-tool

Tool for **manipulating GPX files for Strava**:

- setting time
- setting heart rate
- merging two files

## How to use it

**Input**: GPX file. It must contain waypoints (for example generated by [Google maps](https://maps.google.com) or [Mapy.cz](https://mapy.cz)). It could also contain time tag and possibly heart rate special tag (Garmin `TrackPointExtension/v1`), so it can process files exported from Strava.

**Output**: GPX file in format that could be imported via [Strava upload page](https://www.strava.com/upload/select) to Strava.

This tool operates in two different modes - filling values (time and/or heart rate - could be combined) and merging files.

### Filling values (time and heart rate)

This mode is useful when you have GPX file with missing time or heart rate values and you want add them manually.

**When you want add time, you must specify start and end times (in UTC) and also the pace.**

The timestmap will be written to each waypoint. It is computed regardless of route profile - it is assumed that each part was run in the defined pace and every 200 meters (variable `PAUSE_LIMIT_METERS`) is inserted the pause time (proportionally based on the difference between overall and active times).

Example of filling time values:

```bash
python strava-gpx-tool.py fill input.gpx --pace 4:44 --start-time "2018-09-15 17:53:10" --end-time "2018-09-15 19:39:50"
```

Filling the heart rate is similar to filling time and they could be combined. This tool simply adds the defined heart rate to each waypoint.

Example of filling just heart rate:

```bash
python strava-gpx-tool.py fill input.gpx --hr 144
```

### Merging GPX files

This mode reads two GPX files and simply concatenates the *file1* and *file2* to the output. It preserves all waypoint informations.

Example of merging two files:

```bash
python strava-gpx-tool.py merge input1.gpx input2.gpx
```
